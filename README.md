  Synopsis
</h1>

“ Fact extraction from a given Query with ranking as relevancy ” - The problem statement is to develop a system that can extract relevant facts or information from multiple websites when a query is entered/searched. The system will utilize a mixture of several techniques and advance algorithms. The main goal is to provide users with accurate and useful information from the websites that is most relevant to their query by ranking them.

  Motivation
</h1>

The amount of digital data is growing at an unprecedented rate, and extracting relevant information from this data has become increasingly challenging. Automated fact extraction systems have the potential to address this issue by quickly and accurately extracting relevant information from a large amount of unstructured data. Information retrieval is an important research area that focuses on developing algorithms and systems to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of data.

In recent years, there has been significant research interest in developing automated systems that can extract facts or information from websites when a user enters a query. Such systems have numerous applications, including providing users with quick and accurate answers to their queries, facilitating knowledge discovery, and supporting decision-making processes.

However, despite the advancements in the field of information retrieval, the development of an effective fact extraction system remains a challenging task. In particular, there are several issues that need to be addressed, such as identifying the most relevant information from websites, dealing with noisy and incomplete data, and evaluating the effectiveness of the fact extraction system.

We aim to propose a novel approach for extracting relevant facts or information from web pages using a combination of web scraping, extraction based on weighting, fact extraction, and BM25 for ranking. The proposed approach will be evaluated using real-world data, and we’ll get the desired output.
